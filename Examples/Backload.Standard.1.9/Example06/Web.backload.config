    thumbsUrlPattern: Thumbnails should be generated dynamically. We force the Backload component to generate a link to itself. By default a direct link to a stored thumbnail file is returned.
                      Important note: thumbsUrlPattern is a Pro feature. It will work locally but not remote.
    getInclSubFolders: On a GET request we want to include the search in subfolders, as we have multiple in this example.
